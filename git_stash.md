## Description

Git offers you many useful commands. One of them is `git stash`, which allows you to put some of your changes aside.

### Why is this important?

`git stash` is one of the handiest commands for programmers, especially when you work with a team and need to switch quickly between your branches and other team members' branches.
There is a high likelihood that you will have some work in progress code changes that you need to save quickly and come back to later to finish.
