# AAA pattern

## Learning objectives
- Use AAA pattern for unit tests.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description
It's always a good idea to organize your code in a clean manner. Conventions and patterns bring predictability to your code and improve readability. In testing, one of the most popular patterns is AAA. It divides the test code into 3 well-separated sections: Arrange, Act & Assert.

### Why is the AAA pattern important?
Due to the popularity of the AAA pattern, you will surely come across it when working with existing codebases. The ability to recognize it and act according to the existing rules will allow you to quickly and efficiently start contributing to the dev team. 

- Read this short article about [unit testing and the AAA pattern](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/title-testing-code-ocd-and-the-aaa-pattern-df453975ab80).

## Additional materials 
**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**
- Read about [testing best practices](https://blog.logrocket.com/javascript-testing-best-practices/). The first part is dedicated to the AAA pattern and the rest of the article provides some handy tips and best practices that will be useful as you write more complex tests.
